**CSS Display Property:**
- The lecture focuses on explaining and demonstrating the CSS `display` property and its various values.

**Key CSS Properties:**
1. `*`: Universal selector that resets margin and padding to zero for all elements.
2. `.box`: A container with a blue border, inline-block display, a width of 344 pixels, 45 pixels of padding, and a 34-pixel margin.
3. `.box1`: An example of how to hide an element using `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`.

**HTML Content:**
- Two `<div>` elements with class `.box` and `.box1`.
- Two `<span>` elements.

**Key Concepts:**
- The `display` property in CSS controls how an element is displayed in the layout.
- `display: inline-block` allows elements to be inline but also accept width and height properties.
- Elements with `display: none` are not displayed and do not take up any space in the layout.
- `visibility: hidden` hides the element, but it still occupies space in the layout.
- Choosing the appropriate `display` value is essential for controlling the layout and visibility of elements.

The lecture provides practical examples of how the `display` property can be used to control the visibility and layout of HTML elements. Understanding these concepts is vital for creating responsive and well-structured web pages.
