**Lecture Notes - Video 48: Animation Exercise - Bouncing Ball**

In this exercise, Harry tasks us with creating an animation for a bouncing ball. The provided HTML and CSS code sets the initial structure of a red ball inside a blue container. The goal is to animate the ball moving horizontally from left to right while bouncing within the container.

### Approach:

1. **Set Initial Styles:**
   - The ball (`.box`) is styled with a red background, circular shape (border-radius), and positioned at the bottom-left of the container.
   - The container (`.container`) is styled with a blue background, and its dimensions are set to create a visible area for the bouncing animation.

2. **Define Keyframes:**
   - Create keyframes for the animation using `@keyframes`. Two keyframes are needed for the bouncing effect.
   - The first keyframe (`from`) sets the initial position of the ball at the bottom-left.
   - The second keyframe (`to`) defines the final position of the ball after bouncing. Adjust the position to create a bouncing effect.

3. **Apply Animation Property:**
   - Apply the animation property to the `.box` class, specifying the name of the animation, duration, timing function, and iteration count.
   - Use the `alternate` value for the animation direction to make the ball bounce back and forth.

### Key CSS Classes:

- `.box`: Styles for the bouncing ball (height, width, background color, position).
- `.container`: Styles for the container (position, dimensions, background color).

### Key CSS Properties:

- `@keyframes`: Define keyframes for the bouncing animation.
- `animation`: Apply the animation to the ball with specified parameters (name, duration, timing function, iteration count, direction).

### Notes:

- The `position: absolute;` and `position: relative;` combination is used to position the ball relative to its container.
- Adjust the values in the keyframes to control the height and width of the bouncing motion.
- Experiment with different timing functions to achieve varied bouncing effects.

This summary provides an approach to solving the exercise. Refer to the video for the complete solution code and a detailed explanation from Harry.
