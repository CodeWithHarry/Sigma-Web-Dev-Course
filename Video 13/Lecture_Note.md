**index.html:**
- **DOCTYPE Declaration:** The document begins with a standard HTML5 declaration.
- **HTML Structure:** The HTML structure includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Character Encoding:** A `meta` tag specifies the character encoding as UTF-8.
- **Title:** The `<title>` tag defines the title of the page as "Document."

**HTML Elements and Codes:**
1. **Text Content:** The body of the webpage contains textual content, including the expression "3>4."

2. **Escaped HTML Elements:** The code includes escaped HTML elements using HTML entities, such as `&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;`, which represents the `<p>` tags.

3. **`<pre>` Element:** A `<pre>` element is used to display preformatted text. Inside the `<pre>`, there is a `<p>` element, followed by multiple lines of text and spaces.

4. **Copyright Symbol:** The `&copy;` entity is used to display the copyright symbol. Multiple `&nbsp;` entities are used to add extra non-breaking spaces.

5. **`<blockquote>` Element:** A `<blockquote>` element is used with the `cite` attribute set to "source-url." The blockquote contains quotation text.

6. **Headings:** An `<h1>` element is used to create a heading with the text "This is html boilerplate code."

7. **Code within `<pre>` and `<code>` Tags:** HTML code is displayed within a `<pre>` element, and further code formatting is applied within a `<code>` element. This code represents HTML boilerplate.

This video lecture provides examples of various HTML elements and codes, including escaped HTML entities, preformatted text, copyright symbols, blockquotes, headings, and code formatting within HTML documents.
