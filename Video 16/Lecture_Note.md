**index.html:**
- **DOCTYPE Declaration:** The document begins with a standard HTML5 declaration.
- **HTML Structure:** The HTML structure includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Character Encoding:** A `meta` tag specifies the character encoding as UTF-8.
- **Title:** The `<title>` tag defines the title of the page as "Document."

**Webpage Content:**
- An `<h1>` heading is used to introduce the webpage, titled "My Videos and Audios for the Day."
- An `<h2>` subheading, "Some Videos for the Day," indicates the beginning of the video section.
- The video section includes five `<video>` elements, each featuring a different video file (1.mp4, 2.mp4, 3.mp4, 4.mp4, 5.mp4). Each video element includes the `controls` attribute for playback control and specifies the video's width as 239 pixels.

- Another `<h2>` subheading, "Some Audios for the Day," marks the start of the audio section.
- The audio section contains five `<audio>` elements, each linked to a different audio file (1.mp3, 2.mp3, 3.mp3, 4.mp3, 5.mp3). Similar to the video elements, the audio elements include the `controls` attribute for audio playback control.

This video lecture presents a solution to a previous task, where the goal was to design a webpage for showcasing videos and audios. The webpage is organized with clear headings and subheadings, making it easy for users to navigate between the different multimedia content items.
