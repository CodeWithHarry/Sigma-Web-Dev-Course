**index.html:**
- **DOCTYPE Declaration:** The document begins with a standard HTML5 declaration.
- **HTML Structure:** The HTML structure includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Character Encoding:** A `meta` tag specifies the character encoding as UTF-8.
- **Title:** The `<title>` tag defines the title of the page as "CSS Boxmodel."

**CSS Styling:**
- The `<style>` block within the `<head>` section contains CSS rules that apply to various elements:
  - A universal selector sets margin and padding to zero for all elements.
  - Two classes, "box1" and "box2," define styles for boxes with different colors, padding, margins, borders, and heights. The `box-sizing: border-box;` property is used to include padding and border within the element's total width.

**HTML Elements:**
- The `<body>` section contains two `<div>` elements with classes "box1" and "box2." These elements represent boxes with distinct styling properties.

**Box Model Properties:**
- The boxes exhibit the key concepts of the CSS box model, including:
  - **Content:** The content area of each box with a background color of "aqua."
  - **Padding:** Defined by the `padding` property, with different values for "box1" and "box2."
  - **Margin:** Specified by the `margin` property, with varying margins for each box.
  - **Border:** Created using the `border` property, with distinct colors for the borders.
  - **Height:** The height of each box is set to 200px.

This video lecture demonstrates the CSS box model, which defines how elements are displayed in terms of content, padding, border, and margin. It explains the use of box-sizing to control how padding and borders affect the element's total dimensions. The lecture provides practical examples of how these properties affect the layout and appearance of HTML elements.
