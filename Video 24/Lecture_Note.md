**index.html:**
- **DOCTYPE Declaration:** The document begins with a standard HTML5 declaration.
- **HTML Structure:** The HTML structure includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Character Encoding:** A `meta` tag specifies the character encoding as UTF-8.
- **Title:** The `<title>` tag defines the title of the page as "CSS Shadow and Outlines."

**CSS Styling:**
- The lecture focuses on explaining and demonstrating the use of CSS for creating shadows and outlines.

**Key CSS Properties:**
1. `.box`: A container with a black border, 34-pixel padding, and a box shadow. The box shadow is defined with horizontal and vertical offsets (5px, 15px), blur radius (5px), and a shadow color (#70a711).
2. `.text-element`: A text element with a text shadow defined with horizontal and vertical offsets (10px, 5px), blur radius (3px), and a shadow color (#e695f7).

**HTML Content:**
- A `<div>` element with class `.box`.
- A `<p>` element with class `.text-element`.

**Key Concepts:**
- The `box-shadow` property allows you to create a shadow effect around an element. It is defined by specifying the horizontal and vertical offsets, blur radius, and shadow color.
- The `text-shadow` property is used to add a shadow to text. It's defined in a similar way to `box-shadow` with horizontal and vertical offsets, blur radius, and shadow color.

The lecture provides practical examples of how to use these properties to create visual effects on elements, enhancing the overall design and appearance of web content.

Understanding how to apply shadows and outlines using CSS is valuable for creating visually appealing and interactive web pages.
