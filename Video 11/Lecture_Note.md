**index.html:**
- **DOCTYPE Declaration:** The document begins with a standard HTML5 declaration.
- **HTML Structure:** The HTML structure includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Character Encoding:** A `meta` tag specifies the character encoding as UTF-8.
- **Title:** The `<title>` tag defines the title of the page as "Semantic Tags."

**Semantic Tags:**
- **Header Section:**
  - A `<header>` element is used to define the header section of the webpage. It contains a navigation menu inside a `<nav>` element. The navigation menu consists of an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>`) for "Home," "About," and "Contact."

- **Main Content:**
  - The main content of the webpage is enclosed in a `<main>` element. Inside the `<main>`, there is an `<h1>` heading with the text "What are Semantic Tags."

- **Footer:**
  - A `<footer>` element is used to define the footer section of the webpage. It contains a copyright notice, "Copyright CWH | All rights reserved."

**Commented-Out Element:**
- An `<img>` element is commented out, which suggests that it's not included in the current version of the webpage.

This video lecture highlights the use of semantic HTML tags to structure the webpage's content logically. Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` improve the clarity and accessibility of the webpage for both humans and search engines.
