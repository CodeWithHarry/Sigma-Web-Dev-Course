  - Products
  - Pricing
  - Resources
  - About Us
  - Language Selector

#### Main Section:
##### First Section (class="first"):

##### Second Section (class="second"):
- Display of UltraEdit download options in a grid layout.
- Each download option includes:
  - Language type
  - Download buttons for 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

### CSS Styles:

- Styling for the header, navigation, and logo.
- Styling for the promotional content in the first section.

- Responsive design with a media query for screens with a maximum width of 1145px.

### Key CSS Classes:

- .logo: Styles for the UltraEdit logo.

- .first: Styles for the first section content.
- .second: Styles for the second section content.
