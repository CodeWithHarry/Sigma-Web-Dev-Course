# Video Lecture 7: Working with HTML Forms

In this lecture, we dive into the world of HTML forms. Forms are essential for collecting data from users on your website. Here's what you've learned:

1. **HTML Form Structure:**
   - Forms are enclosed within the `<form>` element.
   - The `action` attribute specifies the URL where the form data will be sent when submitted.

2. **Text Input:**
   - You've created a text input field using the `<input>` element with `type="text"`.
   - The `for` attribute is used for labeling the input field, enhancing accessibility.
   - `autofocus` is added to the input field for automatic focus when the page loads.

3. **Radio Buttons:**
   - Radio buttons are used for mutually exclusive options.
   - Created using `<input type="radio">`.
   - The `name` attribute groups them, ensuring only one option is selected.

4. **Checkboxes:**
   - Checkboxes allow users to select multiple options.
   - Created with `<input type="checkbox">`.
   - Use the `name` attribute to group related checkboxes.

5. **Textarea:**
   - `<textarea>` is used for multi-line text input.
   - Specify the number of rows and columns with the `rows` and `cols` attributes.

6. **Dropdown Menu (Select Element):**
   - Created using the `<select>` element.
   - Options are defined with the `<option>` element.
   - Users can choose from the available options in a dropdown menu.

These elements are the building blocks for creating interactive and user-friendly forms on your web pages. They allow users to provide information, make selections, and interact with your website. Proper labeling and structuring are essential for accessibility and user experience.

Now, you're well-equipped to design and implement forms on your website, collecting user data and enhancing interactivity. Keep practicing and experimenting to solidify your understanding of HTML forms!
