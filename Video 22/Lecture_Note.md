**index.html:**
- **DOCTYPE Declaration:** The document begins with a standard HTML5 declaration.
- **HTML Structure:** The HTML structure includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Character Encoding:** A `meta` tag specifies the character encoding as UTF-8.
- **Title:** The `<title>` tag defines the title of the page as "Document."

**CSS Values and Units:**
- In this lecture, various CSS values and units are explained and demonstrated.

**CSS Box Model:**
- The lecture covers topics related to the CSS box model and how values and units are applied.

**Key CSS Properties and Units:**
1. `*`: Universal selector that resets margin and padding to zero for all elements.
2. `html`: Sets the base font size to 12 pixels.
3. `.box`: A container with a width of 80% of the viewport width (80vw), a height of 10% of the viewport height (10vh), and aquamarine background.
4. `.container`: A container with similar properties as `.box`, but with a minimum height of 80% of the viewport height (80vh), and a font size of 18 pixels.
5. `.container > div`: Divs within the `.container` with a font size of 2em, 50% width, and a red border.
6. `.container > div > div`: Nested divs within `.container > div` with a blue border and 50% width.
7. `.mycont`: Another container with a width of 80% of the viewport width (80vw), black border, 22px font size, and a margin of 23px.

**HTML Content:**
- `<div>` elements with class `.box`, `.container`, and `.mycont`.
- Nested `<div>` elements within `.container` and `.container > div`.

**Key Concepts:**
- CSS values and units determine how properties like width, height, and font size are measured.
- Units like vw (viewport width), vh (viewport height), em (relative to the parent font size), and pixels are used to control the layout and appearance of elements.
- The box model properties like margin, padding, and borders play a crucial role in the layout of elements.
- Using CSS values and units effectively is essential for responsive design and consistent layout.

This video lecture provides a practical demonstration of CSS values and units in action, highlighting their impact on the layout of HTML elements.
