# Lecture Notes - Three Ways to Add CSS to HTML (Video Lecture 15)

**index.html:**
- **DOCTYPE Declaration:** The document begins with a standard HTML5 declaration.
- **HTML Structure:** The HTML structure includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Character Encoding:** A `meta` tag specifies the character encoding as UTF-8.
- **Title:** The `<title>` tag defines the title of the page as "Document."
- A commented-out `<style>` block is included, demonstrating an alternative way to add CSS within the HTML file.

**Linked CSS:**
- An external CSS file is linked to the HTML using the `<link>` tag with the `rel` attribute set to "stylesheet" and the `href` attribute pointing to "style.css."

**HTML Elements:**
- The `<body>` section contains the following HTML elements:
  - An `<h1>` element with the text "Three ways to add CSS to HTML."
  - A `<div>` element containing an ordered list (`<ol>`) with three list items describing different methods of adding CSS.
  - A `<p>` element with the text "Everyone is good in some way or the other. Does this even make any sense?"

**style.css:**
- The "style.css" file is linked to the HTML, and it contains CSS rules that target `<h1>` elements.
- The CSS rules define a red background color (`background-color: red`) and yellow text color (`color: yellow`) for `<h1>` elements.

This video lecture discusses the three main methods of adding CSS to HTML: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS. It demonstrates the use of an external CSS file ("style.css") to style the `<h1>` element with a red background and yellow text color. The lecture emphasizes the importance of using external CSS for consistent styling across multiple web pages.
