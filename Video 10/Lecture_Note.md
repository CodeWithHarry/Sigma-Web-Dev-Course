**index.html:**
- **DOCTYPE Declaration:** The document begins with a standard HTML5 declaration.
- **HTML Structure:** The HTML structure includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Character Encoding:** A `meta` tag specifies the character encoding as UTF-8.
- **Title:** The `<title>` tag defines the title of the page as "Document."

**Multimedia Elements:**
1. **Video Element:**
   - An `<video>` element is used to embed a video with the `src` attribute pointing to "video.mp4."
   - The `height` attribute is set to 255 pixels.
   - Attributes like `controls`, `loop`, `muted`, and `poster` are added for video control, looping, muting, and a poster image.

2. **Audio Element:**
   - An `<audio>` element is used to embed an audio file with the `src` attribute pointing to "sachin.mp3."
   - Attributes like `controls`, `autoplay`, `loop`, and `muted` control audio playback.

3. **SVG Image:**
   - An SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image is embedded using an `<svg>` element.
   - A circle is drawn within the SVG with specific attributes for positioning, radius, stroke, stroke width, and fill color.

4. **Image Element:**
   - An `<img>` element is used to display an SVG image with the `src` attribute pointing to "img.svg."
   - The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image.

5. **IFrame:**
   - An `<iframe>` element is included with a commented-out `<iframe>` for reference.
   - A YouTube video is embedded using an `<iframe>` element, where the `src` attribute points to a YouTube video's URL.
   - Various attributes like `width`, `height`, `title`, and others are set to control the embedded video's behavior.

This video lecture demonstrates the embedding of various multimedia elements within an HTML document, including video, audio, SVG images, images, and iframes for external content like YouTube videos.
