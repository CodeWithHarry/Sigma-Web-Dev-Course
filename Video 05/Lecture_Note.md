**index.html:**
- **DOCTYPE Declaration:** The document begins with a standard HTML5 declaration.
- **HTML Structure:** The HTML structure includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Character Encoding:** A `meta` tag specifies the character encoding as UTF-8.
- **Title:** The `<title>` tag defines the title of the page as "Images."
- **Linking Stylesheet:** A `<link>` tag is used to link an external CSS stylesheet ("style.css") to the HTML document.

**Images:**
- An `<img>` tag is used to display an image with the `height` attribute set to 230 pixels. The `src` attribute points to an image file ("image.png"), and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image ("Train image").

**Table:**
- A `<table>` element is used to create a table structure.
- The table includes `<caption>` for a title, `<thead>` for the table header, `<tbody>` for the table body, and `<tfoot>` for the table footer.
- The table contains rows and cells (represented by `<tr>` and `<td>` tags) with data like "Name," "Designation," and "Favorite Language."

**Unordered List:**
- A list is created using the `<ul>` element with `type` set to "square." It contains several list items (`<li>`), including names like "Harry," "Rohan," and "Shubham."

**Ordered List:**
- Another list is created using the `<ol>` element with `type` set to "A." It contains ordered list items similar to the unordered list.

**CSS File (style.css):**
- **Styling:** In the CSS file, a style is applied to `<td>` elements, adding a border with a width of 2 pixels and a black color.

This video lecture covers the use of images, tables, and lists in HTML. It demonstrates how to insert images, create table structures, and lists, and apply CSS styling to specific elements for better presentation.
