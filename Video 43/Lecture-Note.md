**Lecture Notes - Video 43: Navbar Exercise Solution**

In this video, the instructor provides a solution for the navbar exercise, where the task was to design a navigation bar for the UltraEdit website using HTML and CSS.

### Key Points:

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - The HTML file includes a header containing a navigation bar.
   - The logo is placed on the left side, and navigation links are on the right.

2. **Logo Styling:**
   - The UltraEdit logo is styled using the `.logo` class.
   - The logo image has a maximum width of 164px to maintain responsiveness.

3. **Navigation Styling:**
   - The navigation bar is a flex container with `justify-content: space-around` for even spacing.
   - The right side of the navigation bar contains a list of navigation links styled using the `.right` class.
   - The links are flex items with a gap of 34px between them.

4. **Navigation Link Items:**
   - Each navigation link item is a list item (`<li>`) containing a `<span>` for text and an `<img>` for the language icon.
   - SVG icons are used for the dropdown arrow and language icon.

5. **Flexbox and SVG Icons:**
   - Flexbox is utilized for easy positioning and alignment of the navigation elements.
   - SVG icons are embedded directly into the HTML code for simplicity.
