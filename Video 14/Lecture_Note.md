**CSS Styles:**
- Inside the `<head>` section, a `<style>` block is used to define CSS styles.
- The CSS rule selects both `<div>` and `<span>` elements and applies the following styles:
  - `color: red` sets the text color to red.
  - `background-color: yellow` sets the background color to yellow.

**HTML Elements:**
- The `<body>` section contains the following HTML elements:
  - Two `<div>` elements with different content, both styled according to the CSS rule.
  - One `<span>` element, also styled according to the CSS rule.
  - A `<p>` element with Lorem Ipsum text.

This video lecture demonstrates the application of CSS styles to HTML elements. The CSS rule provided in the `<style>` block selects and styles `<div>` and `<span>` elements with red text and a yellow background. This lecture Introduced the basics of CSS for styling web content.
