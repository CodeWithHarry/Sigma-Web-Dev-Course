        // The Coffee Machine: In your coffee shop application, you need to simulate the process of brewing coffee asynchronously. Write an async function named brewCoffee that takes the type of coffee and returns a promise. The promise should resolve with a message indicating that the coffee is ready after a random delay.

        function brewCoffee(getMyCoffee) {
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                let randomDelay = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2000) + 1000; // 1 to 3 sec.
                setTimeout(() => {
                    // Add a simple check for brewing issues
                    if (Math.random() < 0.05) {
                        reject('There was a problem brewing the coffee.');
                    } else {
                        resolve(`Your ${getMyCoffee} coffee is ready! Enjoy!`);
                    }
                }, randomDelay);
            });
        }

        const coffeeType = ['Cappuccino','Latte', 'Mocha','Black Coffee'];
        
        let randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * coffeeType.length);  
        let getMyCoffee = coffeeType[randomNum];

        brewCoffee(getMyCoffee)
            .then(message => console.log(message))
            .catch(error => console.error(error));
